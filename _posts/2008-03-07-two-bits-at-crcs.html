<p>I gave a talk in November at the Harvard <a href="http://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/">Center for Research on Computation and Society</a>.  They've archived the <a href="http://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/2007/11/26/wed-november-28-christopher-m-kelty-two-bits-the-cultural-significance-of-free-software/">video</a>, which isn't superb quality, but it means you can't see my face clearly, which is probably a good thing.</p>
