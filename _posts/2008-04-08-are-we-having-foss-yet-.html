<p>I just came back from a small conference at Wash U. in St. Louis on "Open Source and Proprietary Business Models."  The conference had lots of great talks, including a fantabulous presentation by jz whose presentation aesthetic combines equal parts Stephen Colbert and well, jz.  The one part that kind of had me befuddled was that everyone who got up to speak said something like "what I mean by open source is..." or "I don't want to get into ideological battles about free vs. open, so I will just define it this way..."  It rubs me the wrong way to hear this coming out of academics mouths.  Surely our definitions of what this phenomenon are should be converging, not diverging; surely this is an opportunity to refine an analytic vocabulary, not a call for yet more personal opinions and private philosophies.</p>
