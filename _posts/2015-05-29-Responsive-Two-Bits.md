I've been ignoring this website for several years now, which was not my intention.  When Two Bits was published, and for about three years afterwards, I was eager to create a community around the book, to explore, experiment, modulate, extend, embrace, etc.  To a certain extent this happened in exactly the way it often happens for academics--through a slow accumulation of readers who have read, responded, critiqued and challenged the book.  But it also happened in ways that confirm that open access and free software represent a real alternative, grounded in a community of committed, thoughtful and critical users and makers of software.  It's not without its shortcomings, but I certainly don't think there is much in the book that I got wrong, or that has been proven wrong by history. 

Indeed, just recently, my enthusiasm was renewed by a great little article by Nathan Schneider on "[Slow Computing](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121832/pleasure-do-it-yourself-slow-computing)" published in the Nation
one of the reasons for diving back into this site, and creating new, responsive, requisitely bootstrapified site for /Two Bits: The cultural significance of Free software/.  As it was two decades ago, there remains a vibrant community of people who are committed to making and sharing software, even if the cultural distinction between the brogrammer-infused culture that, in some ways, Twitter Bootstrap is actually quite emblematic of, and the activist, post-Snowden creativity of, just to pick one recent example, the Transparency Toolkit is a gorgeous example--even if that distinction is now sharper and more intense than ever before.
