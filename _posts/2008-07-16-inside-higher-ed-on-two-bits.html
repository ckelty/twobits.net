<p>Scott McLemee at Inside Higher Ed has just published a very nice <a href="http://insidehighered.com/views/2008/07/16/mclemee">review</a> of the <em>Two Bits</em> ("It's all Geek to Me"). </p>
<p>Particularly clever is his distinction between nerd and geek: </p>
<blockquote><p>We have, by contemporary standards, a mixed marriage, for I am a nerd, while my wife is a geek. A good thing no kids are involved; we’d argue about how to raise them.   As a nerd, my bias is towards paper-and-ink books, and while I do indeed use information technology, asking a coherent question about how any of it works is evidently beyond me. A geek, by contrast, knows source code....has strong opinions about source code....can talk to other geeks about source code, and at some length. (One imagines them doing so via high-pitched clicking noises.) My wife understands network protocols. I think that Network Protocols would be a pretty good name for a retro-‘90s dance band.</p></blockquote>
<p>I never really thought of it this way--and I'm not sure the distinction would hold up to scrutiny--but the intuition is exactly right.  Something about being a nerd of any description has been confronted recently by the demand to become a geek.  You might have been a book nerd, or a music nerd or a gardening nerd or a hotrod nerd before, but now you are expected to be a geek too. It's part of the general invasiveness of information technology, and it's also why i think understanding free software is a good thing to do if one wants to know why and how this has come to be.  </p>
<p>The review goes on to discuss the book and McLemee, for a nerd (grin), gets it almost all right (nitpick: free software is the older term, by 15 years).  It's a pleasure to be reviewed in a magazine I think so highly of as well. </p>
