<p>I'm happy being <em>anything</em> of the week.</p>
<p>So this is a special pleasure, being profiled by the Times Higher education as the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=403252&amp;c=1">book of the week</a>.Â  Add to that, the review is really fantastic, and the author profile reveals my gentle side... or something</p>
