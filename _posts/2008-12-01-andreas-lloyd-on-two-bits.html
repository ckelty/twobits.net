<p>Andreas Lloyd has an <a href="http://eskar.dk/andreas/blog/2008/11/bit-by-bit/">excellent review</a> of Two Bits on his blog.</p>
<p>I particularly appreciate this because Andreas' work is on the Ubuntu project, and his observations of that project will be very important to understanding the ongoing process of maintaining Free Software.Â  Since my book ends about the time Ubuntu emerged, it's nice to know others are continuing to ask questions like Andreas'.</p>
