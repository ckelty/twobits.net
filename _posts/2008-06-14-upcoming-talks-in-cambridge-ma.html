<p>I'm giving two presentations about the book in Cambridge before I leave for the year.</p>
<p>The first will be at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society's<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2008/06/kelty"> lunch series</a>.  I've been hanging out at the Berkman Center off and on this year, and I'm eager to hear from the smart people who hang out there.  <strong>June 17, noon-thirty.</strong></p>
<p>The other will be as part of the MIT Press Bookstore's <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bookstore/www/events/#kelty">Authors@MIT series</a>.  I'm especially proud of this one because once upon a time I worked at the MIT Press bookstore, and often helped organize exactly this kind of event.  It's like coming home...  I often say that I would never have gotten to this point without that job; i've never felt so tuned in to the state of scholarship as when I spent 20hrs a week thinking about new books... I doubt I will ever be as hip as I was working there... June 24th 5:30pm</p>
