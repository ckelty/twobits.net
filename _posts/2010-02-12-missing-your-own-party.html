<p>The largest spike in attention for this book came and went without me noticing.</p>
<p>The problem with having too much to do and too many different projects is it becomes impossible to keep on top of all the relevant discussions.  Two Bits was reviewed on <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3696">Lambda The Ultimate</a>, a weblog about programming languages.  There are some great comments, including an extensive one about how I am wrong (though I think it is more accurately about how the poster is right than it is about my book being wrong, but that often happens).  <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/87077/A-Long-Incomplete-and-Mostly-Wrong-History-of-Free-Software">Metafilter</a> picked it up.  The spike in traffic was an order of magnitute larger than anything I've gotten since the book was published, and I only just noticed :)</p>
<p>sorry I missed the discussion...</p>
