                    <p>You can download Two Bits <a href="http://twobits.net/pub/Kelty-TwoBits.pdf">in its entirety here</a>. Or you can <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/Two-Bits/">buy a copy.</a></p>

		    <p> Why?  Because in 2007 I convinced Duke University Press that there would be no end of shame in publishing a book about Free Software that was not released to the world for free, as in freedom, and that they might actually learn something about the value of open access from this experiment.  In the course of the last 7 years, I think the experiment proved a success: Duke University Press has sold a respectable number of copies of the conventional printed book and I have seen world-wide downloads and responses from readers and students that certainly exceeded even my high expectations.

Read it, share it, rip it, burn it, re-mix it, use it in class, tell others to read it, ignore it, critique it, turn it into art or a doorstop. </p>

<p>If you want to transform the text, <strong><a href="http://twobits.net/pub/Kelty-TwoBits-HTML.zip"> download the HTML version</a></strong> (zipped), created by Joel Ibarra and Duke University Press.</p>
<p>Both of the HTML versions list the page numbers of the print version. </p>
<p>If you transform the book, or think you might want to transform it (translate it, create a new version,  etc.), let me know, and I will try to host it here.</p>
