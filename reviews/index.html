Reply-to: rms@gnu.org</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a chance to look at some of the book text.<br />
It seems to make interesting points, and it could be<br />
among the better books about this subject.</p>
<p>However, it has one very important flaw: it refers often to<br />
&#8220;intellectual property&#8221; as if that were a coherent thing.  This is a<br />
major flaw.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html.</p>
<p>So I will not be able to give you an endorsement.</p>
